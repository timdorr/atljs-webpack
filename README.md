## An (Gentle) Introduction to Webpack

Code from my talk to the [Atlanta JavaScript Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/AtlantaJavaScript/events/228779962/) about [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).

### Getting Started

Simply install the modules added by `package.json` and set your path so you can run `webpack` anywhere:

```sh
npm install
export PATH=$(npm bin):$PATH
```

Each subfolder is a section of the presentation. If they don't make sense, sorry, you had to be there...
